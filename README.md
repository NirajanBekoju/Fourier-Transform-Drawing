# Fourier Transform Drawing

Note : Detail Information can be found on Proposal and Report.

## Abstract
Drawing any closed path is possible with epicycles using Discrete Fourier Transform. In this project, we have two methods to draw an object with epicycles. 

## First Method
First one is with Canvas Drawing in which the user is given a canvas and he/she is able to draw anything in the given canvas. When the drawing is completed, the program redraws the same path with epicycles.

## Second Method
Second method is with binary images in which the program detects the object in the given Image(White Color represents object and Black Color represents background). Then the coordinate of the given image is extracted from the image whose path is retraced by this program with the help of Discrete Fourier Transform.
